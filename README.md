# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommend a movie to user given the title as input
Objective - Build a movie recommendation system which makes recommendations given the title of the movie as input.
Brief Information about the Recommendation System – 
A recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item/ product, etc.
Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognized examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders.
These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books and search queries.

Approach to build this movie recommendation system is Content-based filtering. Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a spiderman movie the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same spiderman related movies (Spiderman 2, Amazing Spiderman, etc) With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes [Overview, genre, cast, crew, etc.].
